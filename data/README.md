# Webcam
This dataset is the "Webcam" dataset, which appeared in [1]. We collected series
of images from outdoor webcams captured  at different times of day and different
seasons.   We identified  several  suitable  webcams from  the  Archive of  Many
Outdoor  Scenes (AMOS)  dataset [2]  -- webcams  that remained  fixed over  long
periods of  time, protected from the  rain, etc.  We also  used panoramic images
captured by a camera located on the top of a building. Source for each sequences
are as follows:

Chamonix   : AMOS dataset [2]
Courbevoie : AMOS dataset [2]
Frankfurt  : AMOS dataset [2]
Mexico	   : AMOS dataset [2]
StLouis	   : AMOS dataset [2]

Panorama   : Created at EPFL [1]
